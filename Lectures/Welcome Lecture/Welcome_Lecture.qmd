## Weeks 1 and 2

- Week 1 is a little on the light side 
- Week 2 is a little on the heavy side with two short writing pieces that are important to the course overall and a discussion post 
- To help with this:

        - I will begin posting short videos this week to get you started on Week 2 early
        - The writing in Week 2 will be "low stakes" but with a bonus
        - One piece will count as participation for the week and one piece will count as the weekly quiz grade
        - Both grades given will be based on completion and effort
        - Plus, I will give feedback including how these would be graded if they were short writing pieces
        - Plus, I will assign some extra credit based on the quality of work from those assignments

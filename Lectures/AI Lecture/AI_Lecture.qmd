# Basic AI terms

- Machine learning
- Artificial intelligence
- Artificial General intelligence
- Large Language Models (LLMS)
- Examples of LLMS


## Basic AI terms

- Machine learning (ML) is a set of statistical techniques that allow computers to help us with "making sense of complex datasets."^[This is the footnote text.:Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R, Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, Springer, 2023, p. 1., https://www.statlearning.com/]



## Basic AI terms

- Machine Learning (ML)
- Artificial interlligence is "technology that enables computers and machines to simulate human learning, comprehension, problem solving, decision making, creativity and autonomy."^[Stryker, Cole and Eda Kavlakoglu. "What is artificial intelligence (AI)?" IBM, August 16, 2024, https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence]




## Basic AI terms

- Machine learning
- Artificial intelligence
- Artificial General (AGI) is "a field of theoretical AI research that attempts to create software with human-like intelligence and the ability to self-teach." ^[Amazon Web Services. "What is Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)?" https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/artificial-general-intelligence/]


# Basic AI terms

- Machine learning
- Artificial intelligence
- Artificial General intelligence
- Large Language Models (LLMS) are built on huge sets of text data and work by predicting the most likely next word in a sentence.^[IBM. "What are large language models (LLMs)?" https://www.ibm.com/topics/large-language-models]


# Basic AI terms

- Machine learning
- Artificial intelligence
- Artificial General intelligence
- Large Language Models (LLMS)
- Examples of LLMS include GPT-3, GPT-4, Gemini, Copilot, Grok, and BERT.


## Academic Integrity Considerations of AI

- Course specific policies given by professors are the deciding factor in what is considered academic integrity. 
- Nothing mentioned in this course should be considered a substitute for the policies of the professor in any other course. 
- The use of AI in academic work is a rapidly evolving field and the policies of professors may change as the technology changes.
- Misuse of AI can result in academic penalties up to and including expulsion from the university.


## Ethics of AI

- AI can be used unethically in a variety of ways.

        - AI can be used without proper credit to the original authors.
        - AI can be used to produce fake news, fake reviews, even fake research.

        



## Problems with AI and ML

- ML can produce biased results in research.
- LLMs often "hallucinate" or produce text that is not accurate.


## Sample misuse of AI in writing

The assignment was to write a short summary of a Congressional action, either a pending bill, a bill that failed, or a bill that became law. 

## Sample misuse of AI in writing

1. The "Save Our Sports Act" allows college athletes to earn compensation for their name, image, and likeness (NIL). This legislation marks a major shift in NCAA regulations, permitting athletes to sign endorsement deals, receive payment for social media promotions, and negotiate contracts with sports agencies.

## Sample misuse of AI in writing

1. There was never any such act. There was no proposed bill with this or any similar name. It is a complete fabrication.

## Sample misuse of AI in writing


2. The law was inspired by the growing disparity between the revenue generated by college sports programs and the lack of financial benefits provided to athletes. Prior to this legislation, student-athletes were restricted to receiving only scholarships and had no access to additional income despite their significant role in revenue-generating sports for their attended school.

## Sample misuse of AI in writing

2. These things are mentioned in the references, but not in relation to any actual act of Congress.

## Sample misuse of AI in writing

3. Yes, there was significant public pressure for the law. Advocacy from athletes' rights groups, media coverage highlighting the issue, and public support for fairness in college athletics contributed to the push for change. Polls indicated widespread approval among the public and current and former athletes alike.

## Sample misuse of AI in writing

3. Same problem as number 2.

## Sample misuse of AI in writing

4. In the House, the bill was sponsored by Representative Mark Walker. In the Senate, it was sponsored by Senator Amy Klobuchar.
The bill passed with bipartisan support: it received a vote of 350-80 in the House and 65-30 in the Senate.

## Sample misuse of AI in writing

4. A check of the Congressional tracking website shows no that a bill with a similar purpose was sponsored by Mark Walker, but died in committee. Also,

## Sample misuse of AI in writing

5. The act took approximately six months from introduction to final passage, reflecting a relatively swift movement through both chambers of Congress President Joe Biden signed the "Save Our Sports Act" into law in August 2022.

## Sample misuse of AI in writing

5. The President did not sign any such act into law. https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/2022/08/

Mark Walker was no longer in Congress in 2022. https://www.congress.gov/member/mark-walker/W000819


## Sample misuse of AI in writing

6. Arguments for the law included addressing fairness by allowing athletes to benefit financially from their NIL, correcting an inequity that saw athletes generate substantial revenue without sharing in it. Arguments against the law centered on potential disruptions to college sports, including financial strains on smaller programs and concerns about maintaining a level playing field in recruiting.

## Sample misuse of AI in writing

6. Again, there simply was no such law.

## Sample misuse of AI in writing

Positive note: These are real references.

Negative note: They do not mention the "Save Our Sports Act" or support any of the statements made about it. 


## Sample misuses of AI #2 (shorter)

The first misuse produced real references. 

AI often produces references that have problems. 

## Sample misuses of AI #2 (shorter)

These references were incomplete, plain text references. Searching the relevant sources showed they did not exist:

- AI and the job market/employment.
- Learning considerations of AI.

## AI and the job market

- Acemoglu and Johnson argue that the industrial revolution produced inequality when it replaced skilled labor with machines.^[Acemoglu, Daron and Simon Johnson. "Power and Progress: Our Thousand-Year Struggle Over Technology and Prosperity." Public Affairs Books. 2023.]

## AI and the job market

- Industrial revolution and 20th century machine automation
- Substitutes versus complements to labor
- Parallel in AI

## AI and the job market: Automation

- Acemoglu and Johnson argue that the industrial revolution produced inequality when it replaced skilled labor with machines.^[Acemoglu, Daron and Simon Johnson. "Power and Progress: Our Thousand-Year Struggle Over Technology and Prosperity." Public Affairs Books. 2023.]

## AI and the job market: Substitutes vs complements to labor

- They argue that where machines are complements to labor, they can increase productivity and wages. Where they are substitutes, they can reduce wages and increase inequality.
- Complements to labor are machines that work with humans to increase productivity. Substitutes are machines that replace humans in the workforce.

## AI and the job market: Parallel in AI

- AI has the potential to do to knowledge and creative work what the industrial revolution did to manual labor, for good or ill.

Lessons:

        - Have skills that AI can not easily replace
        - Have skills in using AI
        - Have skills in developing AI
        - Have skills in managing AI

        
## Learning Considerations of AI

- In a world where AI can allow anyone to "copy and paste" a written piece in seconds, high level skills in writing, critical thinking, and research are more important than ever.


## Learning Considerations of AI

- AI can be used to help students learn in a variety of ways.
- AI can also short circuit the learning process by providing answers without understanding.


## AI short circuits learning

- AI can provide answers without understanding.

## Appropriate uses of AI

In any use of AI, it is important to consider the following:

        - The purpose of using AI
        - The ethical implications 
        - The potential for misuse 
        - The potential for the AI to short circuit learning
        - The potential that AI could introduce errors into the work
        
## Appropriate uses of AI

Some uses that may be appropriate, with careful consideration:

        - Using AI to generate ideas
        - Using AI to suggest wording or structure
        - Using AI to check grammar and spelling
        - Using AI to check and improve readability
        - Using AI to check for errors in code or potential solutions
        - Using AI to check for errors in data analysis


## Grading by AI

Example: I used an AI grader to grade a sample of essays all of which I had graded at 80% or higher. The highest grade given by the AI was 67%.
